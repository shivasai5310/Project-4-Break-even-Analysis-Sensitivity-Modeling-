About
In this repository, you'll find a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that showcases the power of ARIMA, SARIMA, and SARIMAX models for accurate sales forecasting. The notebook covers:

Data visualization to understand trends
Stationarity checks for accurate modeling
Optimal order selection for model creation
Correlation analysis to fine-tune predictions
Steps
Importing Necessary Libraries
Loading and Preprocessing of Dataset (Time series data)
Visualize the Time Series Data
Check the stationarity of time series data
If not stationary -- > Make the time series data stationary
Plot the Correlation and AutoCorrelation Charts
ARIMA Model
Explanation: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model
Details: Utilizes past observations and their differencing to predict future values.
SARIMA Model
Explanation: Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model
Details: Extends ARIMA to account for seasonality in the time series data.
SARIMAX Model
Explanation: Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model with eXogenous variables
Details: Incorporates external factors (exogenous variables) into the SARIMA model for enhanced forecasting.
Use the model to make predictions
Pros and Cons of ARIMA, SARIMA, and SARIMAX
Usage
